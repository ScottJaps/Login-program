This is an app for recording basic log in information.  Having people type their information in themselves can reduce errors from sloppy handwriting, and also reduce confusing entries by giving people access to check boxes when appilcable.  

A cloud deployment of this app can be found at http://ifoapp.herokuapp.com/
