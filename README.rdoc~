This is an app for recording basic log in information.  Having people type their information in themselves can reduce errors from sloppy handwriting, and also reduce confusing entries by giving people access to check boxes when appilcable.  

To start the app, navigate into the root directory of the app and type "rails server" and point a web browser to "localhost:3000".  Then you can interact with it normally.  When you want to transfer the data to another computer, use the staff login and pull up the information you want using the options and then save the page (crtl-s) and copy those files to a thumb drive.  
Once you have them on a thumb drive you can bring it to any computer and open the file with any web browser and then copy-paste it into excel (you likely need to use paste special for an html table).

If the computer running this program is going to be connected to the internet, then you want to uncomment the first line in app/controllers/ifoapp_controller.rb and set a password there to prevent unauthorized access and the possibility that people could spam you.  The tradeoff is that every time the computer running this program is started up or the web browser is restarted, you will need to log in again.  On the other hand, if it is connected to the network, then you can remotely access it and you won't have to bother with a thumb drive to transfer information.
